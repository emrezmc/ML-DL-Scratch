# ML-DL-Scratch

This repo is made for CEN 348 Artificial Intelligence System course assignments and the codes are not limited to the assignments. 
The purpose of this repo is to understand the basics of machine learning algorithms so codes are used as few ready-made libraries as possible.

1) The first assignment is applying the K-Means algorithm on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set but I preferred to apply Logistic Regression firstly.
2) K-Means algorithm is applied for given dataset.
